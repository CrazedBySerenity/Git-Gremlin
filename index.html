                Welcome to the git gremlins guide to git. 
                The git gremlin is a very nice guy who
                 sits in your project when you use
                  git to help record and 
                  manage your changes.
                  Here he has provided you with a 
                  guide to help you make the best 
                  use of his services!
                  <br>
                  If you'd like to know more about the
                   gremlin species that the git 
                   gremlin comes from, here is a link 
                   to a

             <section id="what-does-he-do">When you initialise git
                in your project, you will summon 
                the git gremlin who will start writing 
                down all your changes in his trusty
                notebook. Then, as you go along
                he will make note of your changes, help 
                you organise them and when it's time
                he will help you send them to others!
